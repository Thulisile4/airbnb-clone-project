## 🧰 Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies to deliver a modern, efficient, and scalable application:

### 🖥️ Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It simplifies the development of secure and maintainable web applications and provides built-in tools for handling authentication, admin interfaces, and database models.

### 🗄️ PostgreSQL
An open-source relational database system used to store and manage application data. It is known for its stability, scalability, and support for complex queries.

### 🔌 GraphQL
A query language for APIs used to request exactly the data needed from the backend. It improves frontend efficiency by reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

### 🌐 HTML, CSS, JavaScript
The core technologies used to build and style the frontend interface of the application.

### ⚛️ React (or Svelte — depending on your stack)
A modern JavaScript library/framework for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components and manage frontend state efficiently.

### 🧪 Jest (or your test tool)
Used for writing unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application code.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated environments, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.

### ☁️ GitHub
A version control platform used to manage and track changes in the project’s codebase, collaborate with team members, and deploy the application.
